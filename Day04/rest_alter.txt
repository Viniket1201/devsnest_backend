     ********alternatives of REST*******
1. GraphQL APIs:-
    * checkBased on tree data model.
    * checkThe most mature alternative to rest at the moment.
    * checkClients fetch data from a single endpoint.
    * checkClients make fewer more efficient requests.
    * checkNo underfetching or overfetching client requests.
    * checkEasier error handling with verbose error messages.
    * checkAccomodates faster iteration cycles.
    * checkMutations, fragments and type system create high UX.
    * checkReduces time to market by giving developers most for less.
    * checkDoes not take advantage of HTTP caching.
2. Falcor APIs:-
    * checkBased on graph data model.
    * checkFalcor is the most dynamic alternative at the moment.
    * checkRetains the idea of a path from REST.
    * checkRetains the idea of references from REST.
    * checkGood fit for data streaming apps.
    * checkGood fit for live updates apps.
    * checkEasy caching and data consistency.
3. gRPC APIs:-
    * checkAccepts and return Protobuf messages.
    * checkUses the HTTP/2 protocol.
    * checkUses programming language syntax with messages.
    * checkA good fit for data streaming.
    * checkProtobuf, unlike JSON, requires a message format.
    * checkA perfect for for microservices architectures.
    * checkNot as mature or widely supported.
    * checkgRPC Gateway uses REST which erodes perceived benefits.
4. JSON-Pure APIs:-
    * checkUse a single transmission method to send a request.
    * checkSeparate data from transmission
    * checkOnly one response code to confirm receipt
    * checkEasy to debug, payloads have domain-specific vocabulary
    * checkCan be shared between transmission channels
    * checkNot statically typed.
